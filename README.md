# BigBasketCartPrediction
Dataset Consists of Various list of items bought from Big Basket ,which items are bought together are predicted using Apriori Algorithm in Association Rule Based Learning.
# Dataset: Association Rule Learning on Big Basket Shopping List
This dataset consists of a collection of shopping lists from Big Basket, an online grocery store. Each row in the dataset represents a single shopping list consisting of various items bought together. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to remove any duplicates or missing values.
# Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction
Items: A comma-separated list of items bought together in a single transaction
# Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori algorithm is an association rule-based learning algorithm that is used to identify frequent itemsets in a transactional dataset. It works by scanning the dataset multiple times to identify the most common itemsets that occur together.

Using Apriori, we can generate rules of the form if itemset A then itemset B based on the frequency of co-occurrence of itemsets A and B in the dataset. These rules can be used to identify patterns in the data and make predictions about which items are likely to be bought together in future transactions.
# Usage
This dataset can be used for association rule learning and to develop predictive models for recommending items to customers based on their shopping history. The dataset can be loaded into any programming language or data analysis tool that supports CSV file format.

To get started, you can use the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets in the dataset and generate association rules based on these itemsets. You can then use these rules to predict which items are likely to be bought together in future transactions.
